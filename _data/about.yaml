# about me
first-paragraph: I am an Associate Professor at the <hightlight>Graduate School of Science and Engineering</hightlight> affiliated with the <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saitama University</a>.

second-paragraph: I am also the Principal Investigator of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrication, Interaction, and Perception Laboratory</a>, where we interest in the research across the Personal Interaction matters in HCI.

research-introduction: I do research in robotics, mainly focusing on applying <code>cognitive architectures to robotic grasping</code> to enable robots with a closely similar human grasping capability. Just imagine the robot enters the kitchen, finds a banana, grasps without crushing it, and brings it back to you. Will be change to contact information.

research-interests:

  - field: xR
    subfields: semantic scene understanding, perception for grasping
  
  - field: Human Perception
    subfields: learning to grasp, manipulative visual-motor skills
    
  - field: Digital Fabrication
    subfields: learning to grasp, manipulative visual-motor skills
